Drawception-Helper
==================

Accepts an image dragged from a web browser, then displays it with a coarse granularity and minimal colors

A highly-addictive game on the internet is Drawception (http://drawception.com). 

In this game, you are given a quick description and 10 minutes to draw this description onto a small panel with a limited color pallete.

When playing this game, you inevitably end up on google images, manually copying an image.

This program simply helps you with the color mapping. A photagraphic image might have thousands of different colours, but 
when playing drawception, you are given a pallete of 16 specific colors to work with.

This application will render the image in these 16 colors.
